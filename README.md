I'm student at UC Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and I love to create!

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building a Slack Bot and API for [Connect@Cal](https://connected.berkeley.edu/) to optimize communication between clients and case managers. 

ðŸŒ± At the moment, Iâ€™m learning how to transfer my artistic abilities to the digital realm using a variety of digital art software! (see my [art account](https://instagram.com/andlauradraws))

* Creating and designed a web application for a [hackathon](https://devpost.com/software/ingrain) that won a $99 prize for best design 
* The contribution's I'll make for this year's [Association of Women Engineers](https://awe.berkeley.edu/) as Operations AWEfficer :heartpulse:
