This summer, I interned at ⚡ [Emerge](http://emerge.io/) to develop and design 3D Virtual Reality experiences using the Unity Game Engine.

😄 From these projects, I've worked with Python, Java, Javascript, HTML/CSS, Ruby on Rails, React, C#, as well as developer tools such as Unity, React, Flask, and Bootstrap to develop software!
