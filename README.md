I'm student at UC Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and I love to create!

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building an interface and API for [Connect@Cal](https://connected.berkeley.edu/) to optimize communication between clients and case managers. 
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to build my own [website](https://lauraspberry.github.io/) that contains my [artworks](https://lauraspberrypie.wixsite.com/website)!
ðŸ‘¯ Some things I'm proud of: 
* The contributions I made as a Co-Founder of [Education For All Foundation](https://www.efaglobal.org/about-us)
* The games I made using Unity: [Shrink](https://lauraspberry.itch.io/shrink) and [Attack of the Boba Vampires](https://troutstick.itch.io/bobavamps-01)
* The curriculum I built for [CS Kickstart](https://cs-kickstart.berkeley.edu/index.html)


ðŸ˜„ From these projects, I've worked with C#, Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS as well as developer tools such as React, Flask, and Bootstrap to develop software.
